# This project is a weather application, capable of presenting all current conditions at every city on the globe.

## I have employed the use axios library to get API and also chosen the format of data between standard, metric and imperial measurements.

## The useState hook is my prefered choice for this project, to set Data and location

## In it is employed some Javascript math functions like

### Math.round()

### num.toFixed()

## The application posesses some very interesting UI.

## I will be adding more functions to display more weather properties
